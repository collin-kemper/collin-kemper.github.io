Suppose that we take some conception of utilitarianism seriously. This would seem to require believing that utility is real. If we also believe that the universe is amenable to scientific understanding, then it would seem that utility must measurable in much the same way that temperature or any other physical quantity is.

Suppose instead that we do not take utilitarianism seriously, and is instead take it as a set of heuristics and pedagogically useful models that point to some deeper, more important thing. If we also believe that the universe is amenable to scientific understanding, then it would seem that this deeper, more important thing must be measurable in much the same way that temperature or any other physical quantity is, and that our failure to articulate this deeper, more important thing is an error.

In general, if we believe that the universe is amenable to scientific understanding, and that there is such thing as value, worth, good, etc., then it would seem that we must believe that this value is measurable in the same way temperature or any other physical quantity is.

The alternative to this is that some part of the universe cannot be understood scientifically. One will generally not be able to quarantine such scientifically incomprehensible phenomenal from causal influence on the rest of the universe, and thus a partially scientifically understandable universe quickly becomes a scientifically incomprehensible universe.

Both utility and any conception of some deeper, more important thing that I can fathom seem to be of and emerge from phenomenal experience. \[It is hard to imagine that any deeper, more important thing, or thing of value, worth, good, etc., would exist only in insensate matter.\]

Thus, starting with a belief that the universe is amenable to scientific understanding, and with a belief in something of value, it seems that we must eventually turn ourselves to the problem of scientifically understanding phenomenal experience.

Doing this seriously and systematically would require a review of the literature and scientific understanding more thorough than I have time for at the moment. However, I will provide a sketch of concrete phenomena that I believe may prove to be useful trailheads for such an undertaking.

- Pain
	+ Headaches
		* Migraines
		* Cluster headaches
		* Tension headaches
	+ Referred pain
	+ Central pain syndrome
	+ Psychogenic pain
- Pleasure
	+ Deep meditative states
		* Persistent non-symbolic experience
	+ Reward, reinforcement, and learning
- Seizures
- Synesthesia \[and other abnormal phenomenologies\]
- Neurobiology of X \[where X is a cognitive, psychiatric, or psychological condition\]
- Pathophysiology of X \[where X is a cognitive, psychiatric, or psychological condition\]
- Neural correlates of X \[where X is a cognitive, psychiatric, or psychological condition\]

The general sketch for why I highlight these particular phenomena is as follows:

- What is happening when something 'bad' is happening?
- What is happening when something 'good' is happening?
- What is happening when the function of the thing temporarily loses much of its ordinary structure and order?
- What is happening when the there are persistent abnormalities in perception?
- The last three are search terms that bring up results relevant to the mechanistic function of phenomena of interest.

The goal of the above is to enumerate concrete empirical phenomena amenable to study via known techniques that come as close as possible to the nebulous, messy, conceptual thing of interest. Such is a technique useful in a broad variety of situations.
