Let us say that there is present moment experience. Let us say that there are different present moments experienced by different entities. Let us say that there is something like value, and that value inheres in present moment experience, and that present moment experience can change, and with it, one's experienced value. Let us say that experience more value is inherently better. Let us say that entities are causally important in determining the amount of value present in experience, both for themselves and for others.

Say that there are resources that entities can have at their disposal. Many actions that an entity might take deplete the resources at their disposal. Some actions accrue resources. Further, some actions that an entity might take deplete the resources of other entities, and some actions increase the resources at the disposal of other entities.

In such a world, the most valuable sorts of action are actions that tend to cause value for the entity and others, and which tend to accrue resources in excess of their cost for the entity that take the action. Such sorts of action would allow for unbounded value creation.

The next most valuable sorts of actions might be actions that increase net value and net resources available to all entities, but which don't accrue more resources to their originators than they cost. Such actions would be sustainable in a large enough group of entities, if they could stably coordinate around taking such actions. However, while increasing net value and resources, they would not be sustainable alone.

Suppose though that there were no actions that increased net resources, for some critical resources (such as free energy). Then, perhaps the best that could be hoped for in the long term is actions that create the most value per net resources lost. However, such resource constraints might not become locally relevant for very long stretches of time.

\[Philanthropy, in such a world, would seem to be about the sorts of actions that accrue net value (and potentially net resources), but which don't accrue more resources than they cost to their originators.\]

In such a world, it may be valuable to ask:

- What value is being generated?
- What resources are being spent and accrued?
- Can one's actions become sustainable through coordination with others?
